# Via Hypothes.is
Annotate anything via the via.hypothes.is proxy service.

## Simple URL swapping

This Firefox Addon does nothing more than prefix this text
`https://via.hypothes.is/` to the current URL, or remove it
if it is there already.

This effectively routes any URL through the "Via Hypothes.is"
proxy service run by [The Hypothesis Project](http://hypothes.is/).

It's just faster than typing it all the time.
